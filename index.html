                            Medicaid is a government program that offers health insurance to low-income individuals and families. It is a federally and state-funded program, which means that both the federal government and the individual states administer it. Medicaid is different in each state, so it’s important to check with your state’s Department of Health to see if you’re eligible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the great things about Medicaid is that it covers a wide range of services, including <a href="https://cadiahealthcare.com/services/nursing-care/">hospital care</a>, doctor visits, prescription drugs, and mental health services. It also covers Rehabilitation Centers. If you’re considering <a href="https://cadiahealthcare.com/services/rehabilitation-delaware/">Rehabilitation</a> Center treatment for addiction or a mental health condition, Medicaid may be able to help pay for it.

                    To apply for Medicaid, you’ll need to gather a few documents and visit your state’s Department of Health. To get started, you’ll need to find out if you’re eligible for Medicaid in your state. This can vary based on factors like age, disability status and income level. If you’re not sure whether or not you qualify for Rehabilitation Center treatment through Medicaid insurance, Rehabilitation Centers are a great resource to contact. Rehabilitation Centers will be able to help you determine your eligibility, as well as answer any questions you may have about treatment and insurance coverage.
